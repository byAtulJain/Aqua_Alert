# Aqua Alert

## Introduction:

### Introduction

Indore, a rapidly growing city, faces significant challenges in its water management system. While the intake of water from the Narmada River is effectively monitored, there is a critical gap in tracking the distribution of water to individual households within the city. This lack of detailed monitoring leads to several issues, including difficulty in detecting leaks, ensuring equitable water distribution, and making informed decisions for system maintenance and upgrades. As the city's population grows and the demand for water increases, these challenges become more pressing, necessitating an advanced and comprehensive solution.

To address these issues, we propose "Aqua Alert," a robust application designed to revolutionize water management in Indore. Aqua Alert aims to provide advanced water metering and tracking, ensuring accurate measurement and fair distribution of water across different zones. The application will offer detailed monthly and yearly reports, visualizations of collected data, and integrated mapping and system management features. Additionally, it will monitor and regulate tanker supply, detect and prevent unauthorized connections, and highlight areas experiencing water shortages on a map. By implementing Aqua Alert, Indore can enhance its water management system, ensuring efficient distribution, reducing wastage, and improving overall water resource management.
